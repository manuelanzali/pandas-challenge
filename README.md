PyCity Schools Analysis:
The Data shows there are two school types in the data; District and Charter. Charter Schools have the lowest Spending Ranges Per Student with small to medium school sizes whereas District has the highest spending ranges per student with Large School Sizes. From the data, as the size of the school #decreases, the overall passing rate increases. Charter Schools tend to be smaller school sizes based on the data, so they show to have the highest average math score, average reading score, percent passing, percent reading, and overall passing rates. Whereas, District with higher school sizes, #has the lowest scores for the same variables above.

Two Observable trends based on the data -
(1) Although Charter Schools tend to have lower school budgets, they have the highest performing schools with the highest overall passing rate.
(2) Larger School Sizes showed a lower overall passing rate whereas Medium School Sizes showed the highest overall passing rate.
